The mobile application „FocusWork“ makes it possible, to let workers (like programmers) manage their working times and breaks accordingly. 

The app provides functionality to create, edit and delete time intervals and offers the user to start them whenever he wants or whenever he has set the starting time. After the specified time, which can always be shown to the user, a sound or push notification will notify the user to have a break or to finish his task. 
Additionally, users can predefine interval templates for a whole day, week or even for a whole month, where single time intervals can be dragged and dropped into a day/week. Also, users are always able to set custom intervals and start them immediately, whenever an unexpected or urgent task arrives. 

On top of this basic idea, companies can use this application to communicate with the whole team by sending out reviews at the end of the week, in which they ask team members how successful they where in managing their time resources and thus get feedback from the whole team. 

While this application is planned to be a local app, in a later stage it will also be possible to save time templates on a server and therefore use them on several devices as well as to share them with other team colleagues or their managers.
